• Contributions: We went through each class and TODO tasks together on a discord call. Both of us discussed and wrote 
the recursions together before implementing the finished code.

• How to run: Make sure you're in the CSCI 1933 folder and run FractalDrawer through the terminal, using "java FractalDrawer".

• Assumptions: x = x coordinates, y = y coordinates.

• Bugs: Had some bugs running the program through Intellij so we recommend using VSCode. The java files kept having errors between each other
(something with a symbol not being found in the Canvas file and being used in the FractalDrawer file) when the code was written out well (in Intellij).

• Outside sources:
– idea1: w2schools.com
– idea2: geeksforgeeks.com
– idea3: Nanyang University Java
- These were used to remind ourselves how to write certain syntax, utilize Scanner functions, and review constructors.

I certify that the information contained in this README
file is complete and accurate. I have both read and followed the course policies
in the ‘Academic Integrity - Course Policy’ section of the course syllabus.
